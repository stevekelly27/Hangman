# Terminal Hangman Game

This is my take on the classic game Hangman.
Users can try to guess the correct word before the 10 lives is up.

## How to play

At the start of the game the computer will generate a random word and have them hidden by -.
The aim of the game is to guess the correct word before all the users lives run out.
The user has 10 lives.


## UX - User Expierence

I want the user to:

 - Clearly understand how to navigate and start the game.
 - Understand what input is required to proceed and that any exception is returned with a message to the user without  causing the game to crash.
 - Clearly see the number of incorrect guesses before the game ends.
 - Clearly see what the hidden word was if the user fails to guess it before the game ends.
 - Continue playing the game once the game has finished without having to reenter the initial inputs from when the game started by giving the user the option of y/n if they want to keep playing
 - Have a fun time playing the game and that it functions as expected.
